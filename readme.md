# Advent of Code 2024
This is my trying my best to maintain a programming streak knowing damn well 
that my duolingo streak never passed 3 days. I will be doing this in both 
python and c++. I new to c++ and hope to learn a lot from AOC. Python is my 
natural habitat, so I really just wanted to give it a shot aswell.
